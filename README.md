## Important Note

This project is designed to **showcase** how to use the Beamable Groups feature and does not include full error handling. As a result, you **may encounter errors**, which will appear in the console. These are expected and meant to demonstrate feature implementation.

### Example  
The **invitation to a group** feature only works if you invite an **existing player**. If you attempt to invite a non-existent player, an error will be logged in the console. 🚀
