# Groups Sample

## Overview

This project is focused on implementing a group management feature for players.

## User Stories

### Completed

- **As a player, I should be able to create a new group, give it a name, and decide if it is private (not listed in search), open (anyone can apply to join), closed (players must receive invites).**
- **As a player, I can see a list of all groups. The new group I created will be in the list.**
- **As a player, I can search for groups by name.**
- **As a player, I can see a list of all the players in the group.**
- **As a player, if I am the group leader, I can create another chat room and give it a name.**
- **As a player who is in a group, I can add messages to the group chat and read messages from other players who leave messages in the group chat in real time.**
- **As a player, if I am in a group, I can view the default group chat and any history of the chat that is available.**

### In Progress

- **As a player, I can join other chat rooms, view the message history, and leave messages.**
  
### Next

- **As a player, I will be the leader of the group and have full control to edit the group or disband (delete) it.**

### To Do

- **As a player, if I am the leader, I can invite someone to the group.**
- **As a player, if I am invited to a group, it appears as a pop-up the next time they log in. They can decide to join or ignore the invite.**
- **As a player, if I am the group leader, I can delete chat rooms Iâ€™ve created.**
- **As a player, if someone puts a message in a chat room, I get a push notification.**
